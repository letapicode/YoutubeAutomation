# Codex Self Reflection

This document summarizes how the Codex agent operates and how it should be guided within this repository.

## Overview
- **Codex** is a cloud-based software engineering agent that performs coding tasks in isolated containers.
- It is powered by **codex-1**, a model optimized for real-world development workflows.
- Each task runs in its own sandbox preloaded with the repository. The agent can read and modify files, run commands, and commit changes.
- Codex provides citations of terminal output and test results for transparency and manual verification.

## Guidance via `AGENTS.md`
- Codex reads `AGENTS.md` files in the repository to learn project conventions, test commands, and style preferences.
- The root `AGENTS.md` here instructs the agent to:
  1. Run `npm install` in `ytapp`.
  2. Run `cargo check` in `ytapp/src-tauri`.
  3. Run `npx ts-node src/cli.ts --help` from the repository root.
- These commands must be executed before committing.

## Working Style
- Codex is trained to follow instructions precisely and to produce clean patches ready for human review.
- When uncertain or when tests fail, it should communicate issues explicitly.
- All code generated by Codex should be manually reviewed before integration.

## Usage Tips
- Assign well-scoped tasks and include any special setup or testing instructions in `AGENTS.md`.
- Provide clear commit messages summarizing the change.
- Codex cannot access external websites during execution, so all dependencies must be installed through scripts or included in the repository.


## Limitations
- The agent runs in an isolated container without internet access unless explicitly enabled by the user.
- If required dependencies are missing, commands or tests may fail. The agent should report such issues and may include a disclaimer about environment limitations in the PR.
