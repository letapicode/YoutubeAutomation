# Design Guide

This project follows a minimalist approach inspired by the principle **"Less but better"**. Interfaces should focus on clarity and essential functions.

## Core Principles
- **Dieter Rams** advocates for useful, honest and unobtrusive products that avoid excess.
- **Jony Ive** focuses on simplicity, refined materials and a seamless user experience.

## Layout
- Use CSS grid for the main `.app` container with a `2rem` gap to allow generous whitespace.
- Rows are flex containers with a `1.5rem` gap for consistent spacing.
- On small screens rows stack vertically, while `[dir="rtl"]` reverses the row direction.
- Spacing follows a strict grid to reinforce order and simplicity.

## Colors & Themes
- Use a restrained palette: light grey backgrounds (`#f5f5f5`) and dark grey text (`#333`).
- Accent colors are defined via variables in `theme.css` and should be used sparingly.
- Buttons rely on `--button-radius` and `--button-shadow` for subtle depth.
- Keep iconography simple and high-contrast.
- Provide a `high` contrast theme for accessibility.

## Motion
- Interactive elements use subtle transitions (`0.2s ease`) for background and shadow changes.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` by avoiding unnecessary animation.

## CSS Recommendations
- Base layout spacing on an 8â€‘pt grid for consistent rhythm.
- Define typography scales in `theme.css` so headings and body text align.
- Honor `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` to disable transitions when requested.

## Components
- Only present controls that are necessary for the task.
- Display selected file paths as plain text instead of editable inputs.
- File inputs should support drag & drop via the `DropZone` component.
- Advanced options are placed inside collapsible panels to keep screens tidy.
- Action buttons may include small SVG icons for clarity.
- Components should remain visually quiet, leaving generous whitespace around elements.
- Typography scales in small increments (1.25x) for harmony.
- When localizing the interface, allow generous horizontal space so text
  expansion in other languages does not break layouts.

Inspired by the work of Dieter Rams and Jony Ive, these rules emphasize clarity, restrained color use and quiet motion.
Always strive for "as little design as possible".
