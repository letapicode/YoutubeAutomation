The initial prompt for this repository was:

"Create a minimal Tauri desktop application that can generate videos from audio, add captions and basic media elements, and upload the result to YouTube. Provide both a GUI built with React/TypeScript and a CLI. Use Rust on the backend to perform the heavy lifting with ffmpeg and whisper for transcription."

Subsequent updates introduced batch processing, subtitle translation utilities and OAuth based YouTube uploads while keeping the architecture lightweight.
