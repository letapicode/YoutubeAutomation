The initial prompt for this repository was:

"Create a minimal Tauri desktop application that can generate videos from audio, add captions and basic media elements, and upload the result to YouTube. Provide both a GUI built with React/TypeScript and a CLI. Use Rust on the backend to perform the heavy lifting with ffmpeg and whisper for transcription."
