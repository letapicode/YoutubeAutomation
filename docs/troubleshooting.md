# Troubleshooting Build Issues

## Capturing Build Logs

When building or running scripts, redirect the output to a file so you can share
any warnings or errors. In PowerShell use `Tee-Object` to see the output while
logging it:

```powershell
cargo build 2>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath build.log
```

The file `build.log` will contain all messages from the command. You can
replace `cargo build` with any build step such as `npx tauri build`.

## Windows Linker Warnings

Messages like `Warning: .drectve '-exclude-symbols:"_ZNâ€¦"' unrecognized` or
`Warning: corrupt .drectve at end of def file` come from the Windows linker when
it does not understand directives generated by the `windows` crate. This is
usually caused by an outdated linker or a mismatched Rust toolchain.

Run the full setup script to install the latest Visual Studio Build Tools and
other dependencies:

```powershell
scripts/setup_windows.ps1
```

If you only need the GTK/WebKit libraries, run:

```powershell
scripts/install_tauri_deps_windows.ps1
```

After installing, update the Rust toolchain with `rustup update` and retry the
build. These steps should resolve most `.drectve` warnings.
