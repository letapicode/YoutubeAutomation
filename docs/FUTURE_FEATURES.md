# Potential Future Features

These ideas came up in earlier discussions and commits. They are not yet implemented but may be explored in upcoming updates.

- **High-contrast theme option** – noted in the accessibility checklist of [design.md](design.md) and related to work from branch `codex/improve-component-accessibility` (#149).
- **Global theme toggles** – extend the light/dark toggle added in branch `codex/add-global-theme-with-toggle-support` (#31) so the entire UI follows a single theme setting.
- **Persistent background queue tasks** – building on branch `codex/implement-automatic-background-queue-processing` (#122) to keep queue jobs running even when the app restarts.
- **`watch-directory` stop command** – inspired by branch `codex/add-watch_stop-command-and-update-cli` (#240) for halting directory monitoring via CLI.
- **Watermark overlay support** – originally implemented in branch `codex/add-watermark-support-to-generation-paths` (#97); future versions could add more positioning and styling options.
